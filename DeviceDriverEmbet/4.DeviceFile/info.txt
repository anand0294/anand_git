We can create the device file manually by using mknod.

mknod -m <permission> <name> <device type> <major> <minor>

-m <permission> is optional that sets permission bits to new device file

<name> device name that should have full path (/dev/ANAND)

<device type> put c for character or b for block driver

<major> major no of driver
<minor> minor no of driver

See statiAllocation.c program and run above cmd to create device file manually.

To create device file dynamically see program version 0.0.5
