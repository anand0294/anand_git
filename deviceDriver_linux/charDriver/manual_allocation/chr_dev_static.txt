Manually Creating Device File

We can create the device file manually by using mknod.

sudo mknod -m <permissions> <name> <device type> <major> <minor>

<name> – your device file name that should have full path (/dev/name)

<device type> – Put c or b

c – Character Device

b – Block Device

<major> – major number of your driver

<minor> – minor number of your driver

-m <permissions> – optional argument that sets the permission bits of the new device file to permissions

Example:

sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/etx_device c 246 0

If you don’t want to give permission, You can also use chmod to set the permissions for a device file after creation.

Use insmod fileName.ko to deploy module into kernel and 
lsmod to see if it is successfully deployed or not
Refer program

Advantages

    Anyone can create the device file using this method.
    You can create the device file even before load the driver.
